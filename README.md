# Algorithmic Design Notebook of a Weaved Façade

This notebook describes the creative process behind the development and optimization of a weave-based façade design. This project was developed using the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/) and the Khepri AD tool, running on the [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

Currently, the [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) viewer for Jupyter does not have a Julia Kernel available online. To run this notebook interactively you must install IJulia on your PC. Alternatively you may just browse through the final version of the notebook on Binder ([here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/KhepriNotebook/WeavedFacade/blob/master/Notebook_WeavedFacade.ipynb)) or here on GitHub by opening the Notebook_WeavedFacade.ipynb file.
